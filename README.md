# Bezier and B-Spline Toolkit

Welcome to the Bezier and B-Spline Toolkit, an open-source library designed for creating, manipulating, and visualizing univariate and bivariate Bezier curves and B-splines. This toolkit is aimed at both educational purposes and practical applications in computer graphics, CAD, and other fields that require curve handling.

## Features

- **Curve Creation**: Easily define and create univariate and bivariate Bezier curves and B-splines.
- **Interactive Manipulation**: Modify control points and weights in real-time and observe the effects on the curves.
- **Visualization**: Robust visualization tools to see curves in 2D and 3D environments.
- **Utility Functions**: Functions for curve evaluation, subdivision, and degree elevation.
- **Export and Import**: Support for exporting and importing curve data in various formats.
